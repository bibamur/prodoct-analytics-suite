Hello!

This repository is created by Dmitrii Murzin for (self-)education purpose and open for everyone who would like to use it. It contains basic tools for product analytics implemented in Python. The approach to the analysis is based on the model of user events: each event is a particular action performed by user in the product (e.g. when user starts or completes particular course assignment).

Following tools are included in this repository:
- Histogram
- Scatter plot (Bivariate analysis)
- Event counts - total and unique
- Retention (daily and by time period)
- Funnels
